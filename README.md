# ParkinsonsGait
we developed classifiers to predict the presence and severity of Parkinson’s Disease from gait recordings. We created a gait segmentation algorithm to extract features indicative of gait abnormalities, and then tested	supervised learning models with forward feature selection.We diagnosed the presence of Parkinson’s with 85% accuracy, and severity with 75% accuracy.
