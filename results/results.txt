Log of changes:
	-Plotted train and test errors to diagnose bias/variance
	-Plotted foot sensor positions
	-Baseline logistic regression on sensor means: 55.3% accuracy
	-Removed serial 7 subjects (306 -> 279 total subjects)... 58.6%
	-Normalize by weight... 61.4%
	-Wavelet decomposition (Marco)
	-Fourier Transform (Kevin)
	-Normalization (Daryl)

Description of images and results:

	-train_test_error_1_mean.png
		-Takes mean across all columns (except Time), then all rows to get the global mean
	-nonPD - Mean: 98.1695057002, variance: 320.685680412
	-PD - Mean: 102.559396496, variance: 197.930537514
