Log of changes:
	-Plotted train and test errors to diagnose bias/variance
	-Plotted foot sensor positions
	-Baseline logistic regression on global means: 56.7% AUC
	-Baseline logistic regression on sensor means: 66.4% AUC
	-Normalize by weight... 64.8% AUC... negligible effect
	-Got stride time mean and variance... 71.6% AUC
	-Included center of pressure measurements... 79.7% AUC

Comparison of models:
	Logistic regression - Training AUC: 77.2%, Test AUC: 76.2%
	SVM with rbf kernel - Training AUC: 99.7%, Test AUC: 50%
	SVM with linear kernel - Training AUC: 74.5%, Test AUC: 67.8%
	Random Forest - Training AUC: 98.6%, Test AUC: 71.4%
	Decision Tree - Training AUC: 99.7%, Test AUC: 73.0%

Feature selection:
	Best features for binary classifier: [26, 33, 25, 2, 8, 30, 0, 22, 32, 5, 38, 36, 21, 12, 24, 35, 16, 10, 18, 9, 11]

Miscellaneous:
	"In the clinical diagnosis of patients with Parkinsonâ€™s or knee osteoarthritis disease, the ambulatory
	estimation of lower extremity movement in the gait is usually necessary [172]. Based on the estimation
	results of the lower extremities, the disease and its severity can be determined, and clinicians can
	establish a proper treatment scheme for the patients." - Sensors paper
