Log of changes:
	-Plotted train and test errors to diagnose bias/variance
	-Plotted foot sensor positions
	-Baseline logistic regression on global means: 56.7% AUC
	-Baseline logistic regression on sensor means: 66.4% AUC
	-Normalize by weight... 64.8% AUC... negligible effect
	-Got stride time mean and variance... 71.6% AUC
	-Wavelet decomposition (Marco)
	-Fourier Transform (Kevin)
	-Normalization (Daryl)
		-Intra-group normalization (according to Tahir) helps?

		-Takes mean across all columns (except Time), then all rows to get the global mean
	-nonPD - Mean: 98.1695057002, variance: 320.685680412
	-PD - Mean: 102.559396496, variance: 197.930537514

	"In the clinical diagnosis of patients with Parkinsonâ€™s or knee osteoarthritis disease, the ambulatory
	estimation of lower extremity movement in the gait is usually necessary [172]. Based on the estimation
	results of the lower extremities, the disease and its severity can be determined, and clinicians can
	establish a proper treatment scheme for the patients." - Sensors paper
